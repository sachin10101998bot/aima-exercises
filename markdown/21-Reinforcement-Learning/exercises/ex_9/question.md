Extend the standard game-playing environment
(Chapter <a class="chapterRef" href="{{site.baseurl}}/game-playing-exercises/">game-playing-chapter</a>) to incorporate a reward
signal. Put two reinforcement learning agents into the environment (they
may, of course, share the agent program) and have them play against each
other. Apply the generalized TD update rule
(Equation (<a class="equationRef" title="" href="#">generalized-td-equation</a>)) to update the
evaluation function. You might wish to start with a simple linear
weighted evaluation function and a simple game, such as tic-tac-toe.
