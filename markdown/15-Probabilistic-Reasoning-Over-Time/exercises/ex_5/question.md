Equation (<a class="equationRef" title="" href="#">matrix-filtering-equation</a>) describes the
filtering process for the matrix formulation of HMMs. Give a similar
equation for the calculation of likelihoods, which was described
generically in Equation (<a class="equationRef" title="" href="#">forward-likelihood-equation</a>).
