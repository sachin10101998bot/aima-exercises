For each of the following assertions, say whether it is true or false
and support your answer with examples or counterexamples where
appropriate.<br>

1.  An agent that senses only partial information about the state cannot
    be perfectly rational.<br>

2.  There exist task environments in which no pure reflex agent can
    behave rationally.<br>

3.  There exists a task environment in which every agent is rational.<br>

4.  The input to an agent program is the same as the input to the
    agent function.<br>

5.  Every agent function is implementable by some
    program/machine combination.<br>

6.  Suppose an agent selects its action uniformly at random from the set
    of possible actions. There exists a deterministic task environment
    in which this agent is rational.<br>

7.  It is possible for a given agent to be perfectly rational in two
    distinct task environments.<br>

8.  Every agent is rational in an unobservable environment.<br>

9.  A perfectly rational poker-playing agent never loses.<br>
